What is the research question? 

Let's try to  understand the political economy of health sector development in Bangladesh. What do we mean by political economy? It means understanding the historical development of health institutions. How they were shaped, why they were shaped like this? 

For example, a major question might? With such a high population growth, why Bangladesh has so few doctors? Why Bangladesh spends so much less in health sector? Compared to South Asian neighbors what is the status of Bangladesh health sector.

Bangladesh, long history of colonial british colonial rule 

Bhore committe report in 1941

public national health service as the one adopted by UK 

provision of medical care is fundamental responsibility of state, articl 15a of the constitution 

pre democratization period - 1971-1990
commitment to better as a political legitimacy 

post democratization: political competition drives health reform

this reforms were targeted at access rather than quality 

impacts were positive, country wide network of public health infrastructure has been established

intense political competition, clientilist political culture 
negatively affected state institutions, health service quality

party in power seeks to strengthen executive control at the expense of the legislature and the judiciary

commonly capture of state institutions

phenomenon of state capture 

winner-take it all system 

the maintenance of client patron relationship 
allow illicit channeling of public resources

Doctor association of ruling party has supreme power in strategic decision making - posting, transfer, promotion

clientelist politics promotes concentration of authority in the hands of the executive in order to maintain patronage relationships

highly centralized administration emerged

as a result administration micromanages issues 

provision of basic amenities are affected

United states only country in the developed world who does not have a comprehensive social health insurance system or tax-funded national health service 

explanation: unique political culture

individualism and personal freedom

protection from state interference
biased the polity against a universal welfare state 

history of the US, settler colony
mainly by European immigrants
often fleeing religious persecution and state oppression 

colony set to establish individual rights 

with passage of time, these values got deeply entrenched into american society
